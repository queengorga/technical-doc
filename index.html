                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. Every time a web page
                    does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content
                    updates, or interactive maps, or animated 2D/3D graphics, or scrolling video jukeboxes, and so on — you can bet
                    that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), JavaScript soon came
                    to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and Internet Explorer 3.0 introduced
                    JavaScript support under the name JScript in August 1996.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is mostly used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, manipulate
                    data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various
                    APIs, and so forth. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and
                    performance improvement of APIs available in browsers.</li>
                    <li>Recently, JavaScript's popularity has expanded even further through the successful Node.js platform - the most popular
                    cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser. Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript as a
                    scripting language to automate things on a PC and build fully functional HTTP and Web Sockets servers.</li>

                    <h1>Variable</h1>
                    <p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a
                    sentence. But one special thing about variables is that their contained values can change. Let's look at a simple
                    example:</p>
                    <code>var button = document.querySelector('button');</code>
                    <p>Variables just make sense, and as you learn more about JavaScript they will start to become second nature.</p>
                    <p>Another special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything — not just strings and numbers.
                    Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things. You'll learn more about this as
                    you go along.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <h1>Declaring a Variable</h1>
                    <p>To use a variable you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we
                    type the keyword var followed by the name you want to call your variable:</p>
                    <code>var myName;<br>
                          var myAge;</code>
                    <p>Here we're creating two variables called myName and myAge.</p>
                    <h1>Initializing a Variable</h1>
                    <p>Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed
                    by an equals sign (=), followed by the value you want to give it.</p>
