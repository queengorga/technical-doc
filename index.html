                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. Every time a web page
                    does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content
                    updates, or interactive maps, or animated 2D/3D graphics, or scrolling video jukeboxes, and so on — you can bet
                    that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), JavaScript soon came
                    to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and Internet Explorer 3.0 introduced
                    JavaScript support under the name JScript in August 1996.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is mostly used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, manipulate
                    data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various
                    APIs, and so forth. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and
                    performance improvement of APIs available in browsers.</li>
                    <li>Recently, JavaScript's popularity has expanded even further through the successful Node.js platform - the most popular
                    cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser. Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript as a
                    scripting language to automate things on a PC and build fully functional HTTP and Web Sockets servers.</li>

                    <h1>Variable</h1>
                    <p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a
                    sentence. But one special thing about variables is that their contained values can change. Let's look at a simple
                    example:</p>
                    <code>var button = document.querySelector('button');</code>
                    <p>Variables just make sense, and as you learn more about JavaScript they will start to become second nature.</p>
                    <p>Another special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything — not just strings and numbers.
                    Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things. You'll learn more about this as
                    you go along.</p><br><hr><br>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <h1>Declaring a Variable</h1>
                    <p>To use a variable you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we
                    type the keyword var followed by the name you want to call your variable:</p>
                    <code>var myName;<br>
                          var myAge;</code>
                    <p>Here we're creating two variables called myName and myAge.</p><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>Initializing a Variable</h1>
                    <p>Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed
                    by an equals sign (=), followed by the value you want to give it.</p>
                    <p>You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time, like this:</p>
                    <code>var myName = 'Sirius';</code>
                    <p>If you write a multiline JavaScript program that declares and initializes a variable, you can actually declare it after
                    you initialize it and it will still work. This is because variable declarations are generally done first before the
                    rest of the code is executed. This is called hoisting — read var hoisting for more detail on the subject.</p><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>Updating a Variable</h1>
                    <p>Once a variable has been initialized with a value, you can change (or update) that value by simply giving it a
                    different value.</p>
                    <code>myName = 'Luna';<br> myAge = 54;</code>
                    <p>You can call a variable pretty much anything you like, but there are limitations. Generally, you should stick to just
                    using Latin characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You shouldn't use other characters because they may cause errors or be hard to understand for an international
                        audience.</li>
                        <li>Don't use underscores at the start of variable names — this is used in certain JavaScript constructs to mean specific
                        things, so may get confusing.</li>
                        <li>Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and will cause an error.</li>
                        <li>A safe convention to stick to is so-called "lower camel case", where you stick together multiple words, using lower
                        case for the whole first word and then capitalize subsequent words. We've been using this for our variable names in the
                        article so far.</li>
                        <li>Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain. Don't just use single letters/numbers, or big
                        long phrases.</li>
                        <li>Variables are case sensitive — so myage is a different variable to myAge.</li>
                        <li>One last point — you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as your variable names — by this, we mean the
                        words that make up the actual syntax of JavaScript! So you can't use words like var, function, let, and for as variable
                        names. Browsers will recognize them as different code items, and so you'll get errors.</li>
                    </ul><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>Numbers and Operators</h1>
                    <p>In programming, even the humble decimal number system that we all know so well is more complicated than you might
                    think. We use different terms to describe different types of decimal numbers, for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integers are whole numbers, e.g. 10, 400, or -5.</li>
                        <li>Floating point numbers (floats) have decimal points and decimal places, for example 12.5, and 56.7786543.</li>
                        <li>Doubles are a specific type of floating point number that have greater precision than standard floating point numbers
                        (meaning that they are accurate to a greater number of decimal places).</li>
                        <p>We even have different types of number systems! Decimal is base 10 (meaning it uses 0–9 in each column), but we also
                        have things like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Binary — The lowest level language of computers; 0s and 1s.</li>
                            <li>Octal — Base 8, uses 0–7 in each column.</li>
                            <li>Hexadecimal — Base 16, uses 0–9 and then a–f in each column. You may have encountered these numbers before when setting
                            colors in CSS.</li><br><hr><br>
                        </ul>
