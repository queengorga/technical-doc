                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. Every time a web page
                    does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content
                    updates, or interactive maps, or animated 2D/3D graphics, or scrolling video jukeboxes, and so on — you can bet
                    that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), JavaScript soon came
                    to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and Internet Explorer 3.0 introduced
                    JavaScript support under the name JScript in August 1996.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is mostly used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, manipulate
                    data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various
                    APIs, and so forth. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and
                    performance improvement of APIs available in browsers.</li>
                    <li>Recently, JavaScript's popularity has expanded even further through the successful Node.js platform - the most popular
                    cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser. Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript as a
                    scripting language to automate things on a PC and build fully functional HTTP and Web Sockets servers.</li>

                    <h1>Variable</h1>
                    <p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a
                    sentence. But one special thing about variables is that their contained values can change. Let's look at a simple
                    example:</p>
                    <code>var button = document.querySelector('button');</code>
                    <p>Variables just make sense, and as you learn more about JavaScript they will start to become second nature.</p>
                    <p>Another special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything — not just strings and numbers.
                    Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things. You'll learn more about this as
                    you go along.</p><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>Declaring a Variable</h1>
                    <p>To use a variable you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we
                    type the keyword var followed by the name you want to call your variable:</p>
                    <code>var myName;<br>
                          var myAge;</code>
                    <p>Here we're creating two variables called myName and myAge.</p><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>Initializing a Variable</h1>
                    <p>Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed
                    by an equals sign (=), followed by the value you want to give it.</p>
                    <p>You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time, like this:</p>
                    <code>var myName = 'Sirius';</code>
                    <p>If you write a multiline JavaScript program that declares and initializes a variable, you can actually declare it after
                    you initialize it and it will still work. This is because variable declarations are generally done first before the
                    rest of the code is executed. This is called hoisting — read var hoisting for more detail on the subject.</p><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>Updating a Variable</h1>
                    <p>Once a variable has been initialized with a value, you can change (or update) that value by simply giving it a
                    different value.</p>
                    <code>myName = 'Luna';<br> myAge = 54;</code>
                    <p>You can call a variable pretty much anything you like, but there are limitations. Generally, you should stick to just
                    using Latin characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You shouldn't use other characters because they may cause errors or be hard to understand for an international
                        audience.</li>
                        <li>Don't use underscores at the start of variable names — this is used in certain JavaScript constructs to mean specific
                        things, so may get confusing.</li>
                        <li>Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and will cause an error.</li>
                        <li>A safe convention to stick to is so-called "lower camel case", where you stick together multiple words, using lower
                        case for the whole first word and then capitalize subsequent words. We've been using this for our variable names in the
                        article so far.</li>
                        <li>Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain. Don't just use single letters/numbers, or big
                        long phrases.</li>
                        <li>Variables are case sensitive — so myage is a different variable to myAge.</li>
                        <li>One last point — you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as your variable names — by this, we mean the
                        words that make up the actual syntax of JavaScript! So you can't use words like var, function, let, and for as variable
                        names. Browsers will recognize them as different code items, and so you'll get errors.</li>
                    </ul><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>Numbers and Operators</h1>
                    <p>In programming, even the humble decimal number system that we all know so well is more complicated than you might
                    think. We use different terms to describe different types of decimal numbers, for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integers are whole numbers, e.g. 10, 400, or -5.</li>
                        <li>Floating point numbers (floats) have decimal points and decimal places, for example 12.5, and 56.7786543.</li>
                        <li>Doubles are a specific type of floating point number that have greater precision than standard floating point numbers
                        (meaning that they are accurate to a greater number of decimal places).</li>
                        <p>We even have different types of number systems! Decimal is base 10 (meaning it uses 0–9 in each column), but we also
                        have things like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Binary — The lowest level language of computers; 0s and 1s.</li>
                            <li>Octal — Base 8, uses 0–7 in each column.</li>
                            <li>Hexadecimal — Base 16, uses 0–9 and then a–f in each column. You may have encountered these numbers before when setting
                            colors in CSS.</li><br><hr><br>
                        </ul>

                    <h1>Conditionals</h1>
                    <p>In any programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different
                    inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is
                    being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime. In this article,
                    we'll explore how so-called conditional statements work in JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision making in JavaScript, from the choice that must be made, 
                    to the resulting outcome of those choices</p><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>If...Else Statements</h1>
                    <p>Basic if...else syntax looks like so in pseudocode:</p>
                    <code>if (condition) { <br> code to run if condition is true <br>} else { <br>run some other code instead <br>} </code>
                    <p>Here we've got:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The keyword if followed by some parentheses.</li>
                        <li>A condition to test, placed inside the parentheses (typically "is this value bigger than this other value", or "does
                        this value exist"). This condition will make use of the comparison operators we discussed in the last module and will
                        return true or false.</li>
                        <li>A set of curly braces, inside which we have some code — this can be any code we like, and will only be run if the
                        condition returns true.</li>
                        <li>The keyword else.</li>
                        <li>Another set of curly braces, inside which we have some more code — this can be any code we like, and will only be run
                        if the condition is not true.</li>
                    </ol><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>Switch Statements</h1>
                    <p>If...else statements do the job of enabling conditional code well, but they are not without their downsides. They are
                    mainly good for cases where you've got a couple of choices, and each one requires a reasonable amount of code to be
                    run, and/or the conditions are complex (e.g. multiple logical operators). For cases where you just want to set a
                    variable to a certain choice of value or print out a particular statement depending on a condition, the syntax can be a
                    bit cumbersome, especially if you've got a large number of choices.</p>
                    <p>Switch statements are your friend here — they take a single expression/value as an input, and then look through a
                    number of choices until they find one that matches that value, executing the corresponding code that goes along with
                    it. Here's some more pseudocode, to give you an idea:</p>
                    <code>switch (expression) { <br>
                           case choice1: <br>
                             run this code <br>
                             break;<br>
                            <br>
                           case choice: <br> 
                             run this code instead <br>
                             break;<br>
                            <br>
                           //include as many cases as you like <br>
                            <br>
                           default: <br>
                             actually just run this code <br>
                         } <br>
                    </code>
                    <p>Here we've got:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The keyword switch, followed by a set of parentheses.</li>
                        <li>An expression or value inside the parentheses.</li>
                        <li>The keyword case, followed by a choice that the expression/value could be, followed by a colon.</li>
                        <li>Some code to run if the choice matches the expression.</li>
                        <li>A break statement, followed by a semi-colon. If the previous choice matches the expression/value, the browser stops
                        executing the code block here, and moves on to any code that appears below the switch statement.</li>
                        <li>As many other cases (bullets 3–5) as you like.</li>
                        <li>The keyword default, followed by exactly the same code pattern as one of the cases (bullets 3–5), except that default
                        does not have a choice after it, and you don't need to break statement as there is nothing to run after this in the
                        block anyway. This is the default option that runs if none of the choices match.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Note: You don't have to include the default section — you can safely omit it if there is no chance that the expression
                    could end up equaling an unknown value. If there is a chance of this, however, you need to include it to handle unknown
                    cases.</p><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>Ternary Operator</h1>
                    <p>There is one final bit of syntax we want to introduce you to before we get you to play with some examples. The ternary
                    or conditional operator is a small bit of syntax that tests a condition and returns one value/expression if it is true,
                    and another if it is false — this can be useful in some situations, and can take up a lot less code than an if...else
                    block if you simply have two choices that are chosen between via a true/false condition. The pseudocode looks like
                    this:</p>
                    <code>( condition ) ? run this code : run this code instead</code>
                    <p>So let's look at a simple example:</p>
                    <code>var greeting = ( isBirthday ) ? 'Happy Birthday Harry Potter - we hope you have a great day!' : 'Good morning Harry Potter!';</code>
                    <p>Here we have a variable called isBirthday — if this is true, we give our guest a happy birthday message; if not, we
                    give him the standard daily greeting.</p>
                    <h1>Loops</h1>
                    <p>Loops, loops, loops. As well as being associated with popular breakfast cereals, roller coasters and musical
                    production, they are also a critical concept in programming. Programming loops are all to do with doing the same thing
                    over and over again — which is termed iteration in programming speak.</p>
                    <p>A loop usually has one or more of the following features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A counter, which is initialized with a certain value — this is the starting point of the loop ("Start: I have no food",
                        above).</li>
                        <li>An exit condition, which is the criteria under which the loop stops — usually the counter reaching a certain value.
                        This is illustrated by "Have I got enough food?", above. Let's say he needs 10 portions of food to feed his family.</li>
                        <li>An iterator, which generally increments the counter by a small amount on each successive loop, until it reaches the
                        exit condition. We haven't explicitly illustrated this above, but we could think about the farmer being able to collect
                        say 2 portions of food per hour. After each hour, the amount of food he has collected is incremented by two, and he
                        checks whether he has enough food. If he has reached 10 portions (the exit condition), he can stop collecting and go
                        home.</li>
                    </ul><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>The standard for loop</h1>
                    <p>Let's start exploring some specific loop constructs. The first, which you'll use most of the time, is the for loop —
                    this has the following syntax:</p>
                    <code>for (initializer: exit-condition; final expression) { <br>// code to run <br>}</code>
                    <p>Here we have:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The keyword for, followed by some parentheses.</li>
                        <li>Inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semi-colons:</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>An initializer — this is usually a variable set to a number, which is incremented to count the number of times the loop
                            has run. It is also sometimes referred to as a counter variable.</li>
                            <li>An exit-condition — as mentioned before, this defines when the loop should stop looping. This is generally an
                            expression featuring a comparison operator, a test to see if the exit condition has been met.</li>
                            <li>A final-expression — this is always evaluated (or run) each time the loop has gone through a full iteration. It usually
                            serves to increment (or in some cases decrement) the counter variable, to bring it closer to the exit condition value.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>Some curly braces that contain a block of code — this code will be run each time the loop iterates.</li>
                    </ol><br><hr><br>In this case, the initializer again comes first, before the loop starts. The do keyword directly precedes the curly braces containing the code to run and the final-expression.
                    <h1>Exiting loops with breaks</h1>
                    <p>If you want to exit a loop before all the iterations have been completed, you can use the break statement. We already
                    met this in the previous article when we looked at switch statements — when a case is met in a switch statement that
                    matches the input expression, the break statement immediately exits the switch statement and moves onto the code after
                    it.</p>
                    <p>It's the same with loops — a break statement will immediately exit the loop and make the browser move on to any code
                    that follows it.</p><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>While and do ... while</h1>
                    <p>for is not the only type of loop available in JavaScript. There are actually many others and, while you don't need to
                    understand all of these now, it is worth having a look at the structure of a couple of others so that you can recognize
                    the same features at work in a slightly different way.</p>
                    <p>First, let's have a look at the while loop. This loop's syntax looks like so:</p>
                    <code>initializer <br>while (exit condition) {<br>// code to run <br><br>final-expression <br>}</code>
                    <p>This works in a very similar way to the for loop, except that the initializer variable is set before the loop, and the
                    final-expression is included inside the loop after the code to run — rather than these two items being included inside
                    the parentheses. The exit-condition is included inside the parentheses, which are preceded by the while keyword rather
                    than for.</p>
                    <p>The same three items are still present, and they are still defined in the same order as they are in the for loop — this
                    makes sense, as you still have to have an initializer defined before you can check whether it has reached the
                    exit-condition; the final-condition is then run after the code inside the loop has run (an iteration has been
                    completed), which will only happen if the exit-condition has still not been reached.</p>
                    <p>The do...while loop is very similar, but provides a variation on the while structure:</p>
                    <code>initializer <br>do { <br>// code to run <br><br>final-expression <br>} while (exit-condition)</code>
                    <p>In this case, the initializer again comes first, before the loop starts. The do keyword directly precedes the curly braces containing the code to run and the final-expression.</p>
                    <p>The differentiator here is that the exit-condition comes after everything else, wrapped in parentheses and preceded by
                    a while keyword. In a do...while loop, the code inside the curly braces is always run once before the check is made to
                    see if it should be executed again (in while and for, the check comes first, so the code might never be executed).</p>
                    <p>Important: With while and do...while — as with all loops — you must make sure that the initializer is iterated so that
                    it eventually reaches the exit condition. If not, the loop will go on forever, and either the browser will force it to
                    stop, or it will crash. This is called an infinite loop.</p><br><hr><br>
                    <h1>Functions</h1>
                    <p>Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task
                    inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having
                    to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as
                    basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters.</p>
                    <p>In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. In fact, we've been using functions all the way through the course so
                    far; we've just not been talking about them very much. Now is the time, however, for us to start talking about
                    functions explicitly, and really exploring their syntax.</p>
                    <p>Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of parentheses — () — and you're not
                    using a common built-in language structure like a for loop, while or do...while loop, or if...else statement, you are
                    making use of a function.</p>
                    <h1>Built-in browser functions</h1>
                    <p>We've made use of functions built in to the browser a lot in this course. Every time we manipulated a text string, for
                    example:</p>
                    <code>var myText = 'I am a string';<br>var newString = myText.replace('string', 'sausage');<br>console.log(newString); <br>//the replace() string function takes a string, <br>//replaces one substring with another, and returns
                    <br>//a new string with the replacement made</code>
